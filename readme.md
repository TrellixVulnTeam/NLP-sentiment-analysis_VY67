NLP sentiment analysis using deep neural network and LSTM, a recurrent neural network.

Sentiment analysis is an important step towards comprehension in natural language processing. Movie reviews and emoji categorizations are convenient sources of highly polarized sentences for use in sentiment analysis. It focuses on understanding the positive or negative tone of a sentence based on sentence syntax, structure and content.


This exercise aims to predict one of 5 categories of emoji based on input sentence, and uses a more powerful method, word embedding, to pre-process the data, and tries both simple 2-layer network and more complex 2-layer LSTM model to account for the effect of sequence in words.
